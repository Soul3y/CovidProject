# CovidProject

The Covid Project is a demonstration of skills in SQL and Tableau through data analysis and visualization on the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
The project uses data from the "[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)" official website, covering death counts, infection rates, vaccination rates, and other relevant metrics. 
In this projetc I had to :
- Import data in SQL server
- Filtered data to include the seeked location et prepare it for exploration.
- Explored relationships between total_cases, total_deaths, population, and death rates in various countries and over time.
- Grouped data by location and population to compare infection rates and death rates across countries and continents.
- Analyzed data on new covid cases in France over time.
- Analyzed global data on covid cases and deaths over time.
- Joined CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations tables to analyze data on population and vaccination rates across countries and continents.
- Calculated rolling people vaccinated to observe vaccination progress over time.

The findings were then visualized in a Tableau dashboard, which provides a clear and interactive representation of the results. The final dashboard offers a detailed overview of the Covid pandemic and its key trends and insights.
